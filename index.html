      <h2>Understanding the Basics</h2>
      <p>Car shipping is a convenient and efficient way to move your vehicle across the country or even internationally. Whether you're relocating, selling a vehicle, or purchasing one from another state, you may find yourself asking: should I hire a <strong>broker</strong> or go directly to a <strong>carrier</strong>? The answer depends on various factors like time, budget, availability, and your experience with the auto transport industry.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="highlight">
      <h2>What Is a Car Shipping Broker?</h2>
      <p>A car shipping broker acts as a middleman between you and the actual transport carrier. Companies like <strong><a href="https://www.amerifreight.net" target="_blank">AmeriFreight</a></strong> specialize in matching customers with the best carriers available, based on location, pricing, and timing. Brokers don’t own trucks—they use their vast network to find a licensed and insured transporter for your vehicle.</p>

      <h2>What Is a Car Shipping Carrier?</h2>
      <p>Carriers are the companies that physically move your vehicle. They own the trucks and equipment used for shipping and are responsible for transporting your car from pickup to delivery. While dealing directly with a carrier might seem more straightforward, it often comes with logistical hurdles and limited availability.</p>

          <h3>Brokers</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Access to a large network of carriers</li>
            <li>Can negotiate competitive rates</li>
            <li>Provide customer service & support</li>
            <li>Handle paperwork & logistics</li>

      <h2>Why Most People Choose Brokers</h2>
      <p>For most people, especially first-time shippers, brokers are the preferred choice. With a company like <strong>AmeriFreight</strong>, you gain access to a reliable network of vetted carriers without the stress of managing the details. Brokers handle quotes, vet transporters, and offer added layers of service protection and support. </p>
    </section>

    <section class="highlight alt">
      <h2>When Going Direct Might Make Sense</h2>
      <p>There are instances when working directly with a carrier may be appropriate—for example, if you've used a specific carrier before and trust their service, or if you're shipping on a tight local route where one carrier operates consistently. But these cases are less common and usually involve some risk or inconvenience.</p>
